Redis Sharding
**************

Redis Sharding - multiplexed server to sharing data on Redis server set.

https://github.com/kni/redis-sharding

                             /- Redis (node 1)
Client 1 ---                /-- Redis (node 2)
             Redis Sharding --- Redis (node 3)
Client 2 ---                \-- Redis (node 4)
                             \- Redis (node 5)

Sharding is done based on CRC32 checksum of key or key tag.

The majority of the commands are supported except the key renaming commands, 
commands of working with sets, transactions, subscription and, of course, server configure. 

For BLPOP and BRPOP commands all the keys should be on one node, that is done with the key tag.
Also for this commands Redis timeout 0 is recommended. 

Perl 5.10 or higher is needed with the following modes installed: String::CRC32, EV.

Launch:

 perl redis_sharding.pl                             --nodes=10.1.1.2:6380,10.1.1.3:6380,...
 perl redis_sharding.pl                 --port=6379 --nodes=10.1.1.2:6380,10.1.1.3:6380,...
 perl redis_sharding.pl --host=10.1.1.1 --port=6379 --nodes=10.1.1.2:6380,10.1.1.3:6380,...


P.S.
Redis Sharding is released in December, 2010, because Redis Cluster will be realeased in March-June, 2011
